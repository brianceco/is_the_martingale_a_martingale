This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, 'roulette.ipynb', which performs Monte Carlo simulations of the martingale betting strategy in roulette in two settings:
    1. The agent plays a fixed number of rounds.
    2. The agent plays until they bankrupt (i.e., their bankroll reaches 0).

A detailed explanation of the theory and motivation underlying these experiments can be found at the aforementioned blog post.
